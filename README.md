Wow that's websites and stuff

To run server, stay in the top directory with the manage.py and run: "**python3 manage.py runserver**"

I recommend looking at the website in ingonito if you're making changes to any of the files.
Sometimes, the cache doesn't update and you'll be left with your old website without the changes even if you have
modified it in some way.
